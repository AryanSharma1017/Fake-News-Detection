A deep learning project that detects **fake vs real news articles** using a **Transformer-based text classification model built from scratch in PyTorch**.

Unlike many NLP projects that rely on prebuilt architectures, this implementation constructs the **core Transformer components manually**, including:

* Token + Positional Embeddings
* Multi-head self-attention
* Scaled dot-product attention
* Feedforward neural networks
* Encoder stacks
* A classification head for binary prediction

The model learns contextual relationships between words in a news article to determine whether the article is **real or fake**.

# 🚀 Project Overview

Fake news spreads rapidly across social media and digital platforms. Traditional NLP methods struggle to capture **long-range dependencies between words** in articles.

This project solves that problem using the **Transformer architecture**, which allows every token in a sequence to attend to every other token.

The system processes news text and predicts whether the article belongs to one of two classes:

* **0 → Real News**
* **1 → Fake News**

---

# 🧠 Model Architecture

The model follows a **Transformer Encoder classification pipeline**:

```
Raw Text
   ↓
Tokenization
   ↓
Vocabulary Encoding
   ↓
Token + Positional Embedding
   ↓
Transformer Encoder Blocks (Self Attention)
   ↓
Sentence Representation
   ↓
Feedforward Classification Head
   ↓
Fake / Real Prediction
```

---

# 🔬 Key Components

## 1️⃣ Tokenization

The text is cleaned and tokenized using whitespace-based tokenization.

```
"The economy is growing fast"
→ ["The", "economy", "is", "growing", "fast"]
```

---

## 2️⃣ Vocabulary Construction

A vocabulary is built from the dataset using frequency statistics.

Special tokens:

| Token   | Purpose                   |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| `<PAD>` | Padding shorter sequences |
| `<UNK>` | Unknown words             |

Parameters used:

```
max_vocab_size = 10,000
min_frequency = 2
```

---

## 3️⃣ Text Encoding

Each article is converted into a **fixed-length sequence**.

```
Max sequence length = 512 tokens
```

Shorter texts are padded.

---

## 4️⃣ Token + Positional Embeddings

Transformers cannot understand word order by default.

Therefore the model combines:

```
Token Embedding
+
Positional Embedding
```

This gives the model information about:

* word meaning
* word position

Output shape:

```
[batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension]
```

---

# ⚡ Scaled Dot Product Attention

The core of the transformer.

The model computes attention using:

```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √d_k) V
```

Where:

| Symbol | Meaning                  |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| Q      | Query                    |
| K      | Key                      |
| V      | Value                    |
| d_k    | dimension of key vectors |

This allows each word to **focus on relevant words across the sentence**.

---

# 🧩 Multi-Head Attention

Instead of using a single attention mechanism, the model splits attention into multiple heads.

Example:

```
embed_dim = 128
num_heads = 4
head_dim = 32
```

Each head learns **different linguistic relationships** such as:

* grammar
* context
* topic relevance
* semantic similarity

---

# 🧱 Transformer Encoder Block

Each encoder block consists of:

1️⃣ Multi-head self attention
2️⃣ Residual connection
3️⃣ Layer normalization
4️⃣ Feedforward neural network

Structure:

```
Input
 ↓
Self Attention
 ↓
Add & Normalize
 ↓
Feedforward Network
 ↓
Add & Normalize
 ↓
Output
```

Multiple encoder blocks are stacked to build deeper representations.

---

# 🎯 Classification Head

After the transformer encoding stage, a sentence representation is extracted and passed through a classifier.

Architecture:

```
Linear Layer
ReLU Activation
Dropout
Linear Output Layer
```

Final output:

```
[batch_size, 2]
```

representing probabilities for:

* Real News
* Fake News
